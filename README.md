# HaukaiRestaurant
The Haukai Restaurant website.
In the website design I followed the principles of accessibility regarding the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.
I have used semantic elements and descriptive links. Declare the language for screen readers.
The website was written in plain english, following the standards with the elements head, nav, main, list, section, article and footer.
I have used headings (h1), and subheadings (h2), (h3).


Security Issues:
Problems that the website can face could be related to the user authentication, the need of protect sensitive user data that is in transit.
Denial of Service attacks and code vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers.
Its recommended the use of HTTPS.

Privacy Policy:
It is included in the website footer.

HTTP allows the retrieval of resources stored in web servers, such as Html, CSS, and JavaScript files.
Content Delivery Networks (CDN) improve websites loading times.
The role of the HTTP caching is to keep updates copies of the original website.
The CDN delivers its content from a server located close to the website user, making the response time faster.
