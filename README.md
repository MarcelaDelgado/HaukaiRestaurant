# HaukaiRestaurant
The Haukai Restaurant website.
In the website design I followed the principles of accessibility regarding the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.
The website was written in plain english, following the standards with the elements head, nav, main, list, section, article and footer.
I have used headings (h1), and subheadings (h2), (h3).

Security Issues:
Problems that the website can face could be related to the user authentication, the need of protect sensitive user data that is in transit.
Denial of Service attacks and code vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers.
Its recommended the use of HTTPS.

Privacy Policy:
It is included in the website footer.
